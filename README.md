# Magnify-WotLK

Magnify is a World of Warcraft WotLK (3.3.5a) add-on which allows the user to zoom the world map in or out. The functionality was copied from [Magnify](https://github.com/luskanek/Magnify), and updated/reworked to support the WotLK map.

**Features**

- Scroll to zoom on world map, click + drag to pan
- Ctrl + Scroll to scale the windowed world map
- Class color player icons on the world map ([before](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee8e0f9b-d80d-4e8b-9e8c-0d518b4a7052), [after](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb266429-6c9f-4f1a-a1b8-a7cb593ba252))
- Options are configurable using `/magnify`
